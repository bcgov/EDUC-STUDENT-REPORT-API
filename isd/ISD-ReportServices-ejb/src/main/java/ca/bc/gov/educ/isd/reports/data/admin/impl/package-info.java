 * <h2>Package Description</h2>

 * Data implementation for business report classes. These classes provide data
 * presented on the administrative reports. The Adapter classes are passed to
 * the Report Service in the test implementations (e.g., ca.bc...test.PSIChoice)
 * because the Report Service does not have the test implementations deployed to
 * the server.
