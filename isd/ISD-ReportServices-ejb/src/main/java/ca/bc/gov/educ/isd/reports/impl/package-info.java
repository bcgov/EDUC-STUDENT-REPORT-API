/**
 * <h2>Package Description</h2>
 * <p>
 * Provides a generic implementation for reports. The packages below this level
 * provide concrete implementations (e.g., for JasperReports). This separation
 * allows different report engines to be used in the future without having to
 * rewrite the reporting service.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Deployment Dependencies</h2>
 * <p>
 * This component requires that BeanUtils and JasperReports are deployed to the
 * JBoss application server. See the project.properties file's
 * manifest.dependencies property for details.
 * </p>
