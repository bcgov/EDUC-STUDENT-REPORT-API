/**
 * <h1> Package Description </h1>
 * This package contains the Java Entities mapped to the TRAX database as well
 * as the EJB's which access the entities. The EJB's contained in this package
 * are accessed from the {@code TRAXAdapterBean} and produce the unmanaged data
 * value objects for the {@code TRAXAdapterBean}. Each data bean handles
 * requests for a type of service ie the {@code ExamDataBean} handles requests
 * for the ExamStudent and the ExamResults requests. The data beans primarily
 * use a JPQL constructor expression to create the unmanaged data value objects.
 * For cases where the attributes require conditional logic outside what is
 * accessible from the constructor or additional data queries from tables which
 * would require an outer join, additional processing calls are made to obtain
 * that data and a 'setter' method is used add the data to the object. In some
 * cases a named query is used to find the entity. These named queries are
 * defined in the Entity classes themselves. In the JPQL all Entities are
 * treated as root level entities. Some Entities required an embedded class to
 * create a primary key as there was no single column which would suffice. The
 * EJBs all adhere to the interface contracts defined in the
 * ISD-Services-EIS-api {@code ca.bc.gov.educ.isd.eis.trax.db} package.
 * <p>
 * Within the system architecture the TRAX adaptor is provided as a component of
 * the resource adaptor layer connecting business services to the external TRAX
 * system.
