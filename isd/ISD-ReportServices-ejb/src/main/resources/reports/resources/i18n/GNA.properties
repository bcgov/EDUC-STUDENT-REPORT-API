section.introduction.numeracy = The Graduation Numeracy Assessment (GNA) is a province-wide assessment required for graduation. Numeracy, like literacy, is an important life skill. You and your school may use your GNA results to understand your areas of strength and how to support your further learning. The GNA also provides information to schools, districts and the Province about how numerate students are in B.C.
section.introduction.results = Your overall result has been categorized into one of four proficiency levels: Emerging, Developing, Proficient or Extending.

# 0 - proficiency code (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4)
# 1 - proficiency title (e.g., Emerging, Developing, etc.)
section.assessment.title.intro = Your result on the Graduation Numeracy Assessment is:
section.assessment.result.level = {0} \u2014 {1}

section.scores.title = Your Raw Scores
section.scores.description = This score indicates how you performed on each Task and is not directly convertible to your proficiency level.

scores.task.base = <b>{0}</b> {1}<br/><i>{2}</i>
